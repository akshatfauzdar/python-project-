# Chatbot Simulator - Python Project

## Project Overview
This is a simple **Chatbot Simulator** built in Python. It interacts with users by responding to their inputs using predefined responses. The chatbot can greet users, answer basic questions, and even say goodbye in a human-like way. The responses are randomly chosen to make interactions feel more dynamic.

## Features
- Greets the user and responds to basic questions.
- Randomized responses for a more human-like feel.
- Recognizes common phrases like "hello," "how are you?", "what's your name?", and "bye."
- Allows users to exit the chat by typing **"exit"**.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Install Python** (if not already installed) from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the Python script by executing:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```
4. Start chatting with the chatbot!
5. Type **"exit"** to end the conversation.

## Code Explanation
The chatbot works using a dictionary of predefined responses. When the user inputs a message, it checks if the message exists in the dictionary. If found, it selects a random response from the list; otherwise, it returns a default response.

## Example Conversation
```
Chatbot: Hello! Type 'exit' to end the chat.
You: Hello
Chatbot: Hi there!
You: What's your name?
Chatbot: I'm your friendly chatbot!
You: Bye
Chatbot: See you later!
```

## Future Enhancements
- Adding **AI-based responses** using NLP.
- Expanding the chatbot's vocabulary for more interactions.
- Integrating a **GUI-based chatbot**.
